# Negotiation Bot
This project introduces an AI-powered negotiation bot as an extension for e-commerce platforms, allowing customers to propose their own prices and engage in real-time price negotiations. By analyzing customer behavior and purchasing history, the bot dynamically adjusts offers and counter-offers, mimicking the experience of in-store bargaining. The system integrates AI-driven personalized pricing, ensuring discounts are applied strategically, maximizing profit potential while improving customer satisfaction. 
The negotiation bot enhances customer engagement, reduces cart abandonment, and fosters loyalty through a more interactive and personalized shopping experience. It offers businesses better insights into customer preferences and pricing strategies, enabling a competitive edge in a crowded market. This solution combines the best of digital convenience with the flexibility and personalization of traditional retail negotiation.
