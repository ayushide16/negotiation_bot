# Negotiation Bot
### Project Description
This project introduces an AI-powered negotiation bot as an extension for e-commerce platforms, allowing customers to propose their own prices and engage in real-time price negotiations. By analyzing customer behavior and purchasing history, the bot dynamically adjusts offers and counter-offers, mimicking the experience of in-store bargaining. The system integrates AI-driven personalized pricing, ensuring discounts are applied strategically, maximizing profit potential while improving customer satisfaction. 
The negotiation bot enhances customer engagement, reduces cart abandonment, and fosters loyalty through a more interactive and personalized shopping experience. It offers businesses better insights into customer preferences and pricing strategies, enabling a competitive edge in a crowded market. This solution combines the best of digital convenience with the flexibility and personalization of traditional retail negotiation.
### Installation and setup instructions

### Usage guidelines
The Negotiation Bot is designed to provide interactive negotiation for products, enabling price adjustments based on:

- Customer Type - Offers custom negotiation paths based on whether a customer is new - or returning.
- Purchase History - The model factors in the number of previous purchases.
- Product Value - Sets the negotiation range, depending on the base and minimum product price.
### Instructions on how OnDemand APIs are utilized in your project
We have not used any OnDemand APIs in this project due to the project requirements. Instead, we implemented custom APIs to fully control the negotiation logic and streamline data flow between the frontend, backend, and database.
